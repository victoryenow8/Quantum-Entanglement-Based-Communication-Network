# Decentralized Quantum Entanglement-Based Communication Network

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized communication network leveraging quantum entanglement principles to enable secure, instantaneous data transfer across vast distances. By combining quantum mechanics with distributed ledger technology, this system provides a revolutionary approach to global communications that transcends classical limitations.

## Core Components

### 1. Entanglement Pair Generation Contract

This smart contract is responsible for creating and managing quantum-entangled particle pairs that serve as the foundation of the communication network.

**Features:**
- On-demand generation of entangled qubit pairs
- Distribution of entangled particles to network participants
- Tracking of entanglement resources using distributed ledger technology
- Integration with quantum hardware interfaces

### 2. Quantum State Teleportation Contract

This component facilitates the instant transfer of quantum information across the network, regardless of physical distance.

**Features:**
- Implementation of quantum teleportation protocol
- Management of classical communication channels required for teleportation
- Verification of successful teleportation operations
- Integration with quantum measurement devices

### 3. Entanglement Purification Contract

This contract maintains the quality of quantum entanglement in the network, essential for reliable communication in the presence of environmental noise.

**Features:**
- Automated detection of degraded entanglement
- Implementation of entanglement purification protocols
- Statistical tracking of entanglement fidelity
- Dynamic adjustment of purification parameters based on network conditions

### 4. Quantum Repeater Contract

This component extends the effective range of quantum communication by managing a network of intermediate nodes that preserve entanglement across long distances.

**Features:**
- Coordination of entanglement swapping operations
- Optimal routing through quantum repeater nodes
- Monitoring of repeater node health and performance
- Fault-tolerant operation with automatic rerouting

## Technical Requirements

- Quantum hardware interface compatible with IBM Q, Rigetti, or equivalent quantum processors
- Distributed ledger implementation (e.g., Ethereum, Polkadot)
- Classical communication infrastructure for synchronization
- Quantum error correction capabilities
- Advanced cryptographic libraries for classical security components

## Usage

### Basic Communication Setup

```javascript
// Initialize the network
const qNetwork = require('quantum-network');
const network = new qNetwork.Network(config);

// Generate entangled pairs
const pairId = await network.generateEntangledPair({
  nodes: ['nodeA', 'nodeB'],
  fidelity: 0.98
});

// Teleport quantum state
await network.teleport({
  from: 'nodeA',
  to: 'nodeB',
  pairId: pairId,
  state: qNetwork.State.fromBloch(1, 0, 0)
});
```

### Advanced Configuration

See `docs/advanced-configuration.md` for detailed information on:
- Configuring quantum repeater networks
- Implementing custom entanglement purification protocols
- Optimizing for specific quantum hardware
- Setting up fault-tolerant operation

## Security Considerations

- Quantum encryption keys are generated using true quantum randomness
- All classical communication channels use post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
- Entanglement verification protocols protect against man-in-the-middle attacks
- Physical security of quantum hardware nodes must be ensured by network participants

## Current Limitations

- Requires specialized quantum hardware for full implementation
- Entanglement fidelity decreases with network size and distance
- Quantum memory limitations affect scaling
- Requires precise timing synchronization between nodes

## Roadmap

- Q2 2025: Integration with additional quantum hardware providers
- Q3 2025: Implementation of topological quantum error correction
- Q4 2025: Expansion of repeater network to global scale
- Q1 2026: Development of application layer protocols
